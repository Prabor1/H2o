# H2o_flow

Automate your machine learning skill with H2o, without writing code make a lot of model and check their performance using leaderboard. You can choose a lot of options what they providefrom the dropdown & H20 will automatically writedown the code.    
It also can train a lot of different algorithm within time and most of the time it provides a good result. But it is not possible to change some hyperparameter without writing code. It is more helpful when you want to train a lot of model within a small amount of time.      

Check *[H2o Documentation](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-zahradnik/4/index.html)* for more advance knowledge. You also an visite H2o on *[github](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3)* for more info about H2o.
